# Application made in Django Framework

## Using a module dj-reservation

Based on [documentation](https://djreservation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtouse.html) I will implement reservation system for a room to use in a different project to book an apartment

The reason here for making it separately, is to practice to do it right and then to apply/costumize it within my other project
